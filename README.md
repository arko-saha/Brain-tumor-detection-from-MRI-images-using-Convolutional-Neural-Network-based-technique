# Brain tumor detection from MRI images using Convolutional Neural Network based technique

The usual method to detect brain tumor is Magnetic Resonance Imaging(MRI) scans. In this project, I developed a machine learning product to classify the images with both positive and negative findings based on the MRI imaging as a part of my coursework. Here, I performed statistical data analysis, developed a convolutional neural network, and presented the model evaluation result. In this project, I was able to detect the findings with 99.50% accuracy.
